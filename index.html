        <p>Welcome to my Github page! I'm <b>jakubg1</b> and in the future I hope to collect more projects here to make a sort of a portfolio!</p>
        <p>This is a weird place: it's linked both from hobby environments as well as from my resume.</p>
        <p>I will not be posting my photos or sharing my full name here because I don't want them to be publicly online, at least for now!</p>
        <p>I'm using my online name everywhere and this would immediately link all my online actions to my real name.</p>
        <p class="addendum">(It's not like I've got half of my real name embedded in my nickname anyways...)</p>
        <p class="addendum">(It's not like Google or other corpos didn't scan enough sites at all so that they know...)</p>
        <p class="addendum">(...And even then, it's not like you can just Google my name... right? RIGHT?!)</p>
        <p class="addendum">(But it still feels uncomfortable for me doing this.)</p>
        <p>This site will be filled with more information at some point.</p>
