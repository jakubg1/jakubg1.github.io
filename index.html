        <p>Welcome to my Github page! I'm <b>jakubg1</b> and in the future I hope to collect more projects here to make a sort of a portfolio!</p>
        <p>This is a weird place: it's linked both from hobby environments as well as from my resume.</p>
        <p>I will not be posting my photos or sharing my full name here because I don't want them to be publicly online, at least for now!</p>
        <p>I'm using my online name everywhere and this would immediately link 10+ years of my online activity to my real name.</p>
        <p class="addendum">(It's not like I've got half of my real name embedded in my nickname anyways...)</p>
        <p class="addendum">(It's not like Google or other corpos didn't scan enough sites at all so that they know...)</p>
        <p class="addendum">(...And even then, it's not like you can just Google my name... right? RIGHT?!)</p>
        <p class="addendum">(But it still feels uncomfortable for me doing this.)</p>
        <p>This site will be filled with more information at some point.</p>
        <h2>A bit about my works</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, I'm kind of an omni-knowledgeable(?) person (I know a lot of different things in computing, languages, frameworks, etc.), which means it's hard to find fully fledged and actually useful projects.</p>
        <p>But there's a lot of projects in general, most important ones linked below.</p>
        <p>Despite the average incompleteness of my projects, I can say I've explored and dipped my toes in quite a few different web frameworks, for example. I've played with <b>XAMPP</b> (PHP), <b>Spring Boot</b> (Java) and <b>Django</b> (Python), and I also somewhat know <b>node.js</b> (JavaScript), but I didn't have the chance to make a project in it. Yet.</p>
        <p>However, my biggest passion is game development. My programming passion has started there and, starting from (literally) Scratch, then TGF2, then Godot for a relatively short time, I've finally landed on <b>LOVE2D</b> and that's where I am today.</p>
        <p>OpenSMCE and Chain Blast are my biggest projects. Both are developed pretty slowly, usually with some periods dead, while others being really active in terms of development.</p>
        <!--
        <p>The most important part is that OpenSMCE, despite being a sphere matcher engine, has a lot of code that can be resued in other projects, but I didn't put enough effort in separating it out so far. Some of these modules are the console or the Resource Manager.</p>
        <p>It hurts when I think about OpenSMCE not even being usable without having a game from 2005, but I am working with an amazing person to bring an actual brand new game to the table!</p>
        <p>And overall, it feels like OpenSMCE is my biggest investment in my life so far. It cannot be experienced (well, without doing some crazy stuff for now), but it is a significant progress towards "great things".</p>
